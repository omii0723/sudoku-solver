# Sudoku Solver

## Description

This is a Python-based Sudoku solver that automatically solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. The program takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle, attempts to fill in the missing numbers, and outputs the completed Sudoku grid.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently explores possible solutions by placing numbers and backtracking when necessary.
- **Validation**: Checks the validity of each number placement according to Sudoku rules (no repeated numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
- **Input Flexibility**: Accepts any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle with `0` representing empty cells.
- **Readable Output**: Displays the original and solved Sudoku grids in a clear, readable format.

## How It Works

1. **Board Representation**:
   - The Sudoku board is represented as a 9x9 grid (a list of lists in Python).
   - Empty spots are denoted by `0`.

2. **Backtracking Algorithm**:
   - The `solve_sudoku` function uses backtracking to try placing numbers (1-9) in each empty spot.
   - It checks each placement's validity using the `is_valid` function.
   - If a placement leads to a solution, the board is solved; otherwise, the function backtracks by resetting the spot and trying the next number.

3. **Validation Function**:
   - The `is_valid` function ensures that placing a number doesn't violate Sudoku rules by checking the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the original unsolved Sudoku board and the solved board (if a solution exists).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Program

1. Clone or download the script.
2. Replace the `board` variable in the script with your own Sudoku puzzle, where `0` represents empty cells:

   ```python
   board = [
       [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
       [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
       [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
       [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
   ]
   ```

3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python sudoku_solver.py
   ```

4. The script will output the original Sudoku board and the solved board.

### Example

```bash
Original Sudoku board:
5 3 . . 7 . . . .
6 . . 1 9 5 . . .
. 9 8 . . . . 6 .
8 . . . 6 . . . 3
4 . . 8 . 3 . . 1
7 . . . 2 . . . 6
. 6 . . . . 2 8 .
. . . 4 1 9 . . 5
. . . . 8 . . 7 9

Sudoku solved successfully!
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6
9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9
```

## Limitations

- The program assumes the input Sudoku board is valid and has a unique solution. It may not handle invalid or unsolvable boards gracefully.
